Intro to Artificial Intelligence

Assignment 1: Find the shortest path (using A* algorithm) between two points on a plane that has convex polygonal obstacles as shown in Figure 3.31

Improvements to Consider:
  - add method to find neighboring nodes without hardcoding
  - add live visualization of the A* Algorithm

Assignment 2: Given an environment with polygonal obstacles, a maximum budget C (i.e., path length), and {S, G}, your goal would be to find the shortest path between S and G such that the path cost is less than C using Algorithm 1 in [Stern 2014].
Test your program with the environment shown in Fig. 3.31 first.
