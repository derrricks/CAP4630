Improvements to Consider:
  - add method to find neighboring nodes without hardcoding
  - add live visualization of the A* Algorithm

Assignment 2 Improvements to Consider:
  
  - budget issue
  - add method to find neighboring nodes without hardcoding
  - add live visualization of the Potential Search Algorithm
